- A project centered on 3D modeling using the halfedge data structure was developed. 
- A cyclic subdivision algorithm is implemented refered to MeshLab to enhance the surface smoothness and realism of 3D planes through an iterative process.
- As the number of iterations increases, the triangles are further subdivided, resulting in a progressively smoother and more realistic 3D representation.



Efficiently manipulate and control the triangle mesh by utilizing a half-edge data structure.
Use MeshLab to implement a cyclic subdivision algorithm to iteratively refine the 3D model.
Due to the increase in triangle subdivision, enhanced smoothness and realism in the 3D plane is achieved as the number of iterations increases.
The project emphasizes the practical application of computational geometry and iterative algorithms in creating visually realistic 3D models, 
demonstrating a deep understanding of mesh manipulation and subdivision techniques.
